This Data Creation with YouTube API project is a Python-based portfolio that harnesses the YouTube API to construct a real-world dataset comprising 11 columns
and 4927 rows, aimed at analyzing distinct attributes of the Top 10 channels on YouTube. The project employs unsupervised algorithms like LDA and K-Means 
clustering to achieve accuracy in analysis. Tech stacks are the NLTK library for text data processing and the Regex library for filtering out irrelevant content. 

In digital media, YouTube is a cornerstone platform, hosting content across diverse niches. Understanding the distinct
The characteristics and performance metrics of the top YouTube channels are paramount in deciphering trends and audience preferences.
This project delves into the realm of data creation utilizing the YouTube API, crafting a comprehensive dataset that encapsulates the dataset serves as a rich 
resource for analyzing and extracting insights from the vast landscape of YouTube content. The project employs advanced methodologies, including unsupervised 
algorithms like LDA Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and K-Means clustering to unveil patterns and trends within the dataset. Leveraging technologies such as the NLTK 
(Natural Language Toolkit) library for text data and the Regex library for filtering out extraneous information. The project ensures the
meticulous handling of the dataset for robust analysis. 
 
Through the lens of data analytics, this endeavor seeks to unearth nuanced insights into the dynamics of YouTube channels, shedding light on crucial metrics 
such as view counts, engagement levels, and content characteristics. By harnessing the power of Python and cutting-edge data analysis techniques, this project 
endeavors to provide actionable intelligence for content creators, markets and stakeholders navigating the ever-evolving landscape of digital media.
